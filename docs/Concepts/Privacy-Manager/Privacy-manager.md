# Privacy manager

Tessera is the privacy manager for [GoQuorum](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net) and [Hyperledger Besu versions earlier than 25.1.0](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/).

A privacy manager consists of two components, each with their own responsibilities:

1. [Transaction manager](Transaction-manager.md)
2. [Enclave](Enclave.md)
