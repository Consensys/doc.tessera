# Use Tessera to generate keys

Use the [`keygen`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Subcommands.md#keygen) subcommand to generate keys and store them in
the following formats:

* [File-based keys](File-Stored-Keys.md)
* Vault keys:
    * [HashiCorp Vault](Hashicorp-Vault.md)
    * [Azure Key Vault](Azure-Key-Vault.md)
    * [AWS Secrets Manager](AWS-Secrets-Manager.md)

You can [configure Tessera to use one or more keys](../Configure/Keys/Overview.md).
