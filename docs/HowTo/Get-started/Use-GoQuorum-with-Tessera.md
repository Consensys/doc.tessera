# Use GoQuorum with Tessera

You can use Tessera as the private transaction manager for [GoQuorum](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net).
Get started with the following tutorials:

- [Create a privacy-enabled network](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/en/stable/Tutorials/Create-Privacy-enabled-network/)
- [Send a private transaction](https://docs.goquorum.consensys.net/en/stable/Tutorials/Send-private-transaction/)

!!! Note

    All Tessera nodes included in a private transaction must be running when the private transaction is sent.
    Otherwise, the transaction doesn't propagate and an error is returned.
