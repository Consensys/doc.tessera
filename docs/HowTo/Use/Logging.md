# Tessera Logging

Tessera uses the Logback logging framework. See the [Logback documentation](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) for detailed information on configuring Logback.

You can [monitor Tessera logs using Splunk or Elastic Stack (ELK)](Monitoring.md#monitor-logs).

## Log level

Messages are written to the Tessera logs according to the following log levels:

- `ERROR` - System failures or situations that require some action to ensure correct operation of the system
- `WARN` - Notifications that don't require immediate action or that are indications that a transaction failed
- `INFO` - Information message to allow investigation of issues or to provide reassurance that the system is operating correctly
- `DEBUG` - More verbose logging to assist with investigation of issues

The log level is written out in uppercase as part of the log message. You can use this for alert monitoring.

The log level is specified by the Logback configuration file. See the [default configuration file packaged with Tessera](https://github.com/ConsenSys/tessera/blob/master/tessera-dist/src/main/resources/logback.xml). To specify a different log level or logging configuration, pass a customized Logback configuration file on the command line:

```bash
JAVA_OPTS="-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/logback.xml" tessera --configfile config.json
```

## Errors

The following is a non-exhaustive list of error messages and suggested actions. Braces '{}' indicate where further detail of the root cause is logged as part of the message.

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Error decoding message: {error details}` | Invalid base64 in privateFrom/privateFor from the privacy-enabled Ethereum client, or in transaction hash for resend.<br />**Action**: _Sender needs to provide valid base64_ |
| `Error occurred: {error details} Root cause: {root cause}` | Generated for a variety of reasons:<br /><br /> - Invalid content in message, example: <br /><pre>curl -X POST "http://localhost:9001/push" \<br /> -H "accept: application/json" \<br /> -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \<br /> -d "[ \"a garbage string\"]"</pre>- Could not send message to peer, example: <br /><pre>"Root cause: Unable to push payload to recipient url<br />http://localhost:9001/"<br /></pre>**Action**: _depends on the root cause in the log message_ |

| `unable to perform symmetric encryption {error details}` | Unable to encrypt data. Logged error message will give further details.<br />**Action**: _check configuration properties_ |
| `unable to perform symmetric decryption {error details}` | Unable to decrypt data. Logged error message will give further details.<br />**Action**: _check configuration properties_ |
| `Error when executing action {action type}, exception details: {error details}` | Unable to start Influx DB. Logged error message will give further details<br />**Action**: _check configuration properties_ |
| `Error creating bean with name 'entityManagerFactory'` |  | Unable to create connection to database due to failure to decrypt the DB password using the supplied secret key<br />**Action**: _ensure that the correct value is supplied for the secret key_ |
| `Config validation issue: {property name} {error details}` | Invalid configuration detected<br />**Action**: _correct the configuration of the named property._ |
| `Invalid json, cause is {error details}` | Invalid JSON in the configuration file<br />**Action**: _check the configuration file for mistakes._ |
| `Configuration exception, cause is {error details}` | Invalid data in the configuration file<br />**Action**: _check the configuration file for mistakes._ |
| `CLI exception, cause is {error details}` | Invalid command line<br />**Action**: _The error details will give further information regarding the action to be taken._ |

## Warnings

The following is a list of warning messages and possible causes. Braces '{}' indicate where further detail of the root cause is logged as part of the message.

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `Public key {publicKey} not found when searching for private key` | The key in a transaction is not recognized, example: it is not the public key of a known participant node |
| `Recipient not found for key: {public key}` | An unrecognized participant is specified in a transaction.No action needed. |
| `Unable to unmarshal payload` | A received message is corrupt, or incorrectly formatted |
| `Remote host {remote host name} with IP {remote host IP} failed whitelist validation` | Logged if whitelist validation is enabled and the remote host is not in the whitelist.<br />**Action**: _either this is a malicious connection attempt, or mis-configuration_ |
| `Ignoring unknown/unmatched json element: {element tag name}` | An unrecognized element has been found in the configuration file.<br />**Action**: _remove or correct the configuration file entry_ |
| `Not able to find or read any secret for decrypting sensitive values in config` | Secret key (password) could not be read from console or password file (see TESSERA*CONFIG_SECRET in docs).<br />**Action**: \_correction needed for the secret key or the file access permission* |
| `Some sensitive values are being given as unencrypted plain text in config. Please note this is NOT recommended for production environment.` | Self explanatory |
| `Not able to parse configured property. Will use default value instead` | Error in configuration file |
| `IOException while attempting to close remote session {error details}` | Only occurs on shutdown, no action needed |
| `Could not compute the shared key for pub {public key} and priv REDACTED` | Possible cause is that a public key does not match the configured cryptography algorithm.<br />**Action**: _ensure provided key is correct_ |
| `Could not create sealed payload using shared key {shared key}` | Possible cause is that a public key does not match the configured cryptography algorithm.<br />**Action**: _ \_\_ensure provided key is correct_ |
| `Could not open sealed payload using shared key {shared key}` | Possible cause that wrong password was given for key file decryption or making a change to the values in the keyfile so that the password no longer works.<br />**Action**: _ensure that password is correct for the keyfile_ |
| `Unable to generate a new keypair! ` | Internal error - potentially an issue with jnacl dependency |
| `Exception thrown : {exception message} While starting service {service name}` | Internal error - failed to start a service |
| `Invalid key found {remote host url} recipient will be ignored` | Remote key validation check failed.No action needed, however it is a possible indication of a malicious node\_ |
| `Push returned status code for peer {remote peer url} was {status code}` | The peer rejected a transaction 'push' request.<br />**Action**: _check logs on peer to see why it failed_ |
| `PartyInfo returned status code for peer{remote peer url} was {status code}` | The peer rejected a partyInfo request.<br />**Action**: _check logs on peer to see why it failed_ |
| `Unable to resend payload to recipient with public key {public key}, due to {error details}` | The peer rejected a transaction push request during a resend operation.<br />**Action**: _check reason message, or logs on peer to see why it failed_ |
| `Attempt is being made to update existing key with new url. Please switch on remote key validation to avoid a security breach` | Self explanatory |
| `Failed to connect to node {remote node url}, due to {error details}` | A remote node refused partyinfo request. Can occur if: <br /> - remote node is not running<br /> - remote node doesn't recognize this node's public key<br /> - remote node doesn't have this node's IP registered against a key<br /> - etc<br /><br />Can also be expected to occur when nodes are shutdown/restarted, so not necessarily an error. |
| `Failed to connect to node {remote node url} for partyInfo, due to {error details}` | A node failed partyInfo request during resend to peer.<br />**Action**: _check reason message, or logs on peer to see why it failed_ |
| `Failed to make resend request to node {remote node url} for key {public key}, due to {error details}` | Peer communication failed during '/resend' request.<br />**Action**: _check reason message, or logs on peer to see why it failed_ |
| `Connection error while communicating with {uri}` | Peer communication failed during '/push' request.<br />**Action**: _check logs on peer to see why it failed - it may be a failed node requiring restart or removal from peer list_ |
| `An error occurred during batch resend sync stage. {exception error details}` | During the Data Recovery process (`sync` stage), transaction data from a peer either failed the enhanced privacy checks, or could not be stored in the database<br />**Action**: _check error details to see why it failed and determine action to be taken_ |

:::note

Some messages will be rearranged to correct logging levels in our next release.
